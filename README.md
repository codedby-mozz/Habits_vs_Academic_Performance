# Habits_vs_Academic_Performance

**Can your daily habits really predict how well you'll do on an exam?**
This project explores the relationship between student lifestyle habits and academic performance using a dataset from Kaggle. By analyzing features like sleep, study routines, screen time, and diet, we aim to determine which factors most strongly correlate with exam outcomes — and whether we can predict performance from behavior.

## Project overview
This notebook guides you through the full data science workflow:
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation Analysis & Statistical Testing
- Predictive Modeling (Linear Regression)
- Model Evaluation & Interpretation

## Objective
To identify lifestyle habits that significantly influence academic performance and build a simple, interpretable model that predicts exam scores based on those habits. This analysis is meant to provide insights to students, educators, and parents about which daily behaviors may support better academic outcomes.

# Tools & libraries used
- Python – General purpose programming
- pandas / numpy – Data handling and numerical computation
